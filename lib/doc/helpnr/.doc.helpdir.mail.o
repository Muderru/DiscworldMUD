","",8,"Description",3,5,5,"The mailer enables players to send and receive mail to and from other players.  The Ankh Morpork Post Office is located two south, five east, one northeast, one east, one southeast and four south from the bar area of the Mended Drum.  In this room you may \"mail <person>\" to send mail to a person, or simply type \"mail\" to look at mail sent to you. ","",8,"Sending mail",3,5,5,"Once you have typed \"mail <person>\", you are prompted for a subject.  Note that you can mail more than one person in one go, by simply mentioning more names, separated by spaces or commas.The subject is a one line summary of what the mail is about.  If you leave it blank, you leave the sending mail process.  After this you are asked for  Cc's, or Carbon-Copy recipients.  Enter anyone else who should receive the mail, one per line.  Enter a blank line to stop.  Then you can enter the body of the mail itself.  This will be edited with your default editor, the default editor is a menu editor.  Please see \"help edit_help\" for its use.  If you have an alias for \".signature\", then, in a similar format to that of .plan (see finger), it will be appended to your mail. ","",8,"Reading mail",3,5,5,"Typing \"mail\" takes you to the main screen of the Discworld mailer.  This consists of as many message headers as will fit your screen, and a brief description of all the options you have.  To read the next unread mail message, you can just press <enter>.  The last read message has a '>' in front of it and is highlighted.  This is the default message that will be used with a number of options if you don't supply a number.  To read a specific mail message, you may enter its number.  You get a number of other options at this point, all of which can also be viewed by typing '?' in the main menu: ","",7,5,"h [range] ............ Main menu (showing subjects and stuff).  If you			    give a range, the subjects in the range will be			    displayed.  Otherwise as many as will fit your			    screen.  \"h all\" will show all subjects, even			    if that means you get 6 screens at once :-).$ ....................

Display given message.","",3,5,5,"Return on a blank line will display the next unread message.A range is defined as a list of comma separated numbers or spans.  So \"1-2\" is defined as well as \"1,2,3\" and \"all\" is a special case that means all messages, so \"d all\" is a valid command.It does intelligent matching, so if there are 4 messages and you typed  \"d 1-30\" it will delete the 4 messages and will not complain.You can execute all commands by just typing the letter, the mailer will then explain what you have to type. ","",8,"Nicknames",3,5,5,"The mailer can use nicknames, and as just more than nickname-to-name replacement.  The mailer will recognise nicknames when you \"mail <person>\", \"mail <person1> <person2>\", enter Cc's, forward mail, or \"m <person>\" from the main menu.With the \"mail <person1> <person2>\" format, it will expand the entire line as a nickname first.  You could use this for your own form of mailing lists.  Nicknames within these lists are also expanded. ","",8,"Examples",3,5,5,"> mail signe Subject: Hiya sis! Cc:  Enter your text.
